        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>My name is Matthew Larkin. I am from Puyallup, WA but I just moved to Bangor, ME. I will be 26 years old in June. My family is back in Washington including my Mom, Dad, two sisters, and my dog. I enjoy playing video games in my free time, but I also like to play sports as well. I don't really have one single favorite food, but pizza is always a good option.</p>

        <h3>Job History</h3>
        <p>I went into the Air Force shortly after graduating High School. I was a network technician and learned about networking, mostly with Cisco devices. I also worked quite a bit with VoIP and analog phones as well as printers. I separated from the Air Force at the end of 2019 and started working for Motorola Solutions as a System Manager. There I did much more System Administrator related work. I learned a bit about Domain Controllers and Active Directory. I got a lot of practice and am now pretty good at managing virtual RHEL servers. I just quit my job with Motorola to focus on the Code Fellows course and becoming a developer.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Puyallup High School in 2015. After that, I didn't get any formal education in the Air Force, but I did get quite a bit of training. I learned networking and I am certified in CompTIA Security+. At Motorola, I continued to learn on the job and got a bit more training. This Code Fellows course will be the first real education item I get to add to my resume since High School.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>My biggest goal right now is obviously to learn coding. I'm not too sure where I want to go after Code Fellows though. I already know that I like backend work much more than the front end stuff, so I want to trend in that direction. I'm still having a great time learning and improving in class for right now.</p>
